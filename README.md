Windows 10 Spotlight Images Extractor

Based on [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/247643/how-to-save-windows-10s-lock-screen-spotlight-images-to-your-hard-drive/) I've written a Powershell script to help me extract background images that appear on Windows 10 Spotlight during lock screen.

It does not extract only the beautiful background images that I want, but also some trash ;/

However select only those with your current screen width and height and it should be enough to use as a background image ;D

Feel free to fork, use and create an issue if necessary!
